#This is my website/blog
Actually, it's the source code behind my website/blog. It was my first attempt at making a website - miraculously, it didn't end in complete disaster! After three revisions, I think it looks pretty fine. >>> [go here](http://johnbartos.io) <<<

##Technologies
This site is overengineered with the MEAN stack. At the time I chose Angular because it was popular, but I don't think it's that great anymore. It's obviously styled with bootstrap. I accidentally hosted it on the US West region of AWS. 


##The future of johnbartos.io
In the near future I'm going to abandon this project and create a much simpler alternative. One of the key things I've learned from this project is that simple is good, and Angular is far from simple.
