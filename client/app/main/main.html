          <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> I'm a software engineer living in New Jersey, currently
              employed by DataOnline LLC. I graduated from Rutgers in 2014 with
              a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I currently work with .NET C#; however, I enjoy branching out to technologies
              and languages (even JavaScript!). I'm dedicated to learning the art of programming but that's not all I do; I love 3D printing, kayaking, and exercising.</p>
