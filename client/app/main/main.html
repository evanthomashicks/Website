          <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>I'm John, and this is my 40 acres on the windswept hearth of the internet. I'm a Software Engineer living in New Jersey and
              employed by DataOnline LLC, where I program primarily in C# and JavaScript. Currently, I'm working on transforming our monolith SOA into a Microservice-based architecture. I graduated from Rutgers in 2014 with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering; originally, I went in for hardware but somehow ended up specializing in software. In addition to enjoying free-hand programming, in my spare time I like to kayak, mountain bike, loose at MTG, 3D print things.</p>
