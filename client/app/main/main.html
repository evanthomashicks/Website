          <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Hi There! I'm a software engineer living in New Jersey, currently
              employed by DataOnline LLC. I graduated from Rutgers in 2014 with
              a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Somewhere along the line,
              I fell for software and have been working as a developer ever since.
              I currently work with .NET C#; however, I enjoy branching out to technologies
              and languages (even JavaScript!). I'm comfortable working on all layers of
              the stack but I excel on the backend and have a keen sense for
              architecture. I have a strong engineering personality and constantly
              strive to improve myself and my workplace. In my spare time I usually work
              on my 3D printer, chip away at a side project, lift heavy objects, or slack off.</p>
