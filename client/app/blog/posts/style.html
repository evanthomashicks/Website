  Programming is also hard. Style is hard. Programming style? Doubly so. What's easy is to ignore style altogether and <i>Move Fast</i>â„¢. But style is one of the most important aspects of writing good code - and it can make you go faster.
  <br>
  Simply put, style is the way code is presented. Indenting, whitespace, variable naming, bracketing, capitalization, and really way too much to worry about fall under this category. But the simple placement of characters is an oversimplification. A better definition is that style is the <i>intent</i> behind the way code is presented. Style is used to display code in such a way that it's readable, maintainable, and in many cases, more performant. So if you don't have style - get some.
  <br>
  Luckily for you (and me), style is easily stolen. In fact, it's even encouraged! The linter is an invaluable tool to introduce and maintain style based on what a community of developers feel is correct. Linters vary in their degree of opinion and extremes at which they force their style upon you, and are available even for uncool languges like C#. For my Javascript work, I use ESLint with Airbnb's (<a>https://github.com/airbnb/javascript</a>) styleguide and an additional guide made by a friend of mine (<a>https://github.com/ghinks/ConvertingToES2015/blob/master/.eslintrc2015</a>). I used to use JSHint, but I recently switched because I wanted <i>more</i> style. For C#, ReSharper is bar none the best.
  <br>
  So how does style make you move fast? At first, it probably doesn't. Switching from JSHint to ESLint introduced 50+ errors across one of my smaller projects. But adopting a good style gives your code consistency. Consistency gives you (or anyone reading your code) the ability to infer properties and behavior without having to refer back to initial declaration or scan line by line - it's essentially produces a mental hashtable. When variable names are consistent, you can infer their access modifiers and use by name and capitalization alone. Consistent location of variable declaration makes it easy to see what a class or module consists of. Whitespace and indentation consistentency gives you the ability to infer scope and encapsulation. Since programming 90% reading code (and 10% writing), having consistent code makes it much easier for another developer (or future you) to jump in and orient themselves. Get a consistent style and stop yo-yoing around the code base.
