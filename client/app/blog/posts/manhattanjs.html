      Last week was my first visit to the ManhattanJS meetup. And it was awesome. I've been to the AngularJS NYC meetup before but had a mixed experience. In a word, it was sterile - carefully prepared snacks, bouncers at the door, and people standing around awkwardly with hands in pocket. Everyone seemed to know everyone else (but me). The talk was interesting, but I left early.

       But ManhattanJS was awesome. Beer, pizza, and a nice communal layout which made it easy to jump into different groups. Everyone was talking. There was music playing. It was <i>loud</i>. I got into discussions about how awesome Ember, microservice fetishes, and developer life in NYC. After the food, we shuffled over to the adjacent room for the main show - battledecks, followed by a tech talk and a 'passion' talk. For the unaware, battledecks is a game played by giving a presentation about a random set of powerpoint slides in front of an audience. I didn't participate but after a few beers I was wishing I had. The next talk was about hypercard (Apple's 1998 edition of web technology), which humorously mocked the webdev trends with retro tech fads. Soon after was the tech talk. The topic was Mobiledoc, a new way of writing platform-agnostic markup with a bunch of cool features. And then came the 'passion talk'. Each event the organizers choose from a pool of members willing to give a talk about any topic they're passionate about. This event's talk was about YAF - young adult fiction. Animorphs, specifically, and how reading them helped her navigate emotional stress. And how Ellimist, who split into several pieces (each with a different function) when tricked into a black hole, was able to defeat Crayak with his newfound modular nature. Strength over intergalactic beasts - another great benefit of using microservices! Overall, ManhattanJS was a great experience. Next adventure - BrooklynJS!
