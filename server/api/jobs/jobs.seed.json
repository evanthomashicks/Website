We use Silverlight for presentation, IIS for our web server, and SQLServer for our database operations. We perform nightly builds on a cluster of Azure servers and deploy using custom Powershell scripts. However, we occasionally work outside of the Windows sphere.

Additionally, I frequently meet with company owners, management, and clients in order to present current work and design new features.
