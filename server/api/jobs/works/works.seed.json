    "Problem": "Counting carrier packets on the Dolv3 web client created excessive database load, leading to slow page load time and reduced database performance",
    "Solution":"Creation of microservice to perform packet counting in memory and store the count in the database",
    "Result": ["Packet count webpage load time decreased from 30 seconds to under one second", "Eliminated over 2 million database operations per page instance per minute, significantly reducing database strain leading to system-wide performance increases", "Improved code quality by moving business logic out of the user interface and database" ]

    "Problem": "Our current website, Dolv3, is running on the Silverlight platform. Silverlight will be discontinued by major web browsers in the near future, requiring us to build a replacement",
    "Solution":"Development of prototype website utilizing modern web technologies. We decided to use the MEAN stack supplemented by Windows microservices",
    "Result": ["Improved load time of corresponding pages from 4 seconds to under 300 milliseconds",
      "Enhanced user experience though modernization of user interface",
      "Produced quality code in line with current best practices, encouraging code readability, reuse, and extensibility",
      "Validated code correctness through array of unit and integration tests",
      "Established continuous integration environment to build and test code upon pull requests" ]

    "Result": ["Improved security over basic authentication by negating the need to send user credentials through the request header",
       "Achieved authentication request time of approximately 60 milliseconds",
       "Provided automatic token invalidation through time and IP based checks",
       "Facilitated customization of token rules through minimal and complete interface",

    "Result": ["Reduced data retrieval time of 2200 records from approximately 4 seconds to under 400 milliseconds compared to Silverlight system",
      "Prevented unauthorized access to microservices by only publicizing routes needed by the client",
      "Enhanced logging features through centralization of server traffic",
      "Allowed prototype application to operate over a single firewall port, improving system security",
      "Provided functionality to combine REST calls into a single route, allowing the client to do less work"]
